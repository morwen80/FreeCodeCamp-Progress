<!-- 1. Create a dog object with name and numLegs properties,
and set them to a string and a number, respectively. -->
let dog = {
  name: "Laura",
  numLegs: 3.
};


<!-- 2. Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object -->
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Add your code below this line

console.log(dog.name)
console.log(dog.numLegs)


<!-- 3. Create a Method on an Object -->
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + dog.numLegs + " legs."}
};

dog.sayLegs();


<!-- 4. Make Code More Reusable with the this Keyword -->
<!-- (NOTE: I change "dog.numLegs" into "this.numLegs" - so even if the object's name
is changed, we don't have to change all the references in the code. THIS, here, is
associated with.) -->
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + this.numLegs + " legs.";}
};

dog.sayLegs();


<!-- 5. Define a Constructor Function -->
<!-- Constructors are functions that create new objects. They use THIS inside -->
function Dog() {
  this.name = "Laura";
  this.color = 'Shit-brown';
  this.numLegs = 5;
}

<!-- 6. Use a Constructor to Create Objects -->
<!-- On the last line, we created a new instance of Dog named hound.
Hound has all the proprerties of Dog,so we have hound.name ... Rupert -->
function Dog() {
  this.name = "Rupert";
  this.color = "brown";
  this.numLegs = 4;
}
// Add your code below this line
let hound = new Dog()


<!-- 7. Extend Constructors to Receive Arguments -->
<!-- Creating an object with parameters, so it can be applied to everything
(the example n.6, all the new instances of Dogs were named Rupert, for example.
Here we can set new parameters when we create the object.) -->
function Dog(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 4
}

let terrier = new Dog('Anammazzari', 'black')


<!-- Verify an Object's Constructor with instanceof -->
<!-- Anytime a constructor function creates a new object, that object is said to be
an instance of its constructor. JavaScript gives a convenient way to verify this
with the instanceof operator. instanceof allows you to compare an object to a
constructor, returning true or false based on whether or not that object was created
with the constructor.  -->
function House(numBedrooms) {
  this.numBedrooms = numBedrooms;
}

<!-- // Add your code below this line -->
let myHouse = {
  numBedrooms: 1
}

myHouse instanceof House;  ##returns true


<!-- 8. Understand Own Properties -->
<!-- Own properties are defined directly on the object instance itself -->
function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

let canary = new Bird("Tweety");
let ownProps = [];
<!-- // Add your code below this line -->
for (let property in canary) {
  if(canary.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  }
}


<!-- 9. Use Prototype Properties to Reduce Duplicate Code -->
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
  Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");


<!-- 10. Iterate Over All Properties -->
<!-- Adding own properties to the array ownProps and prototype properties to the array prototypeProps -->
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

let ownProps = [];
let prototypeProps = [];

// Add your code below this line
for (let property in beagle) {
  if(beagle.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
    ownProps.push(property);
  } else {
    prototypeProps.push(property);
  }
}
