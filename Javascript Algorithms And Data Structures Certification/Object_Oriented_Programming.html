<!-- 1. Create a dog object with name and numLegs properties,
and set them to a string and a number, respectively. -->
let dog = {
  name: "Laura",
  numLegs: 3.
};


<!-- 2. Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object -->
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Add your code below this line

console.log(dog.name)
console.log(dog.numLegs)


<!-- 3. Create a Method on an Object -->
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + dog.numLegs + " legs."}
};

dog.sayLegs();


<!-- 4. Make Code More Reusable with the this Keyword -->
<!-- (NOTE: I change "dog.numLegs" into "this.numLegs" - so even if the object's name
is changed, we don't have to change all the references in the code. THIS, here, is
associated with.) -->
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + this.numLegs + " legs.";}

<!-- 5. Define a Constructor Function -->
<!-- Constructors are functions that create new objects. They use THIS inside -->
function Dog() {
  this.name = "Laura";
  this.color = 'Shit-brown';
  this.numLegs = 5;
}

<!-- 6. Use a Constructor to Create Objects -->
<!-- On the last line, we created a new instance of Dog named hound.
Hound has all the proprerties of Dog,so we have hound.name ... Rupert -->
function Dog() {
  this.name = "Rupert";
  this.color = "brown";
  this.numLegs = 4;
}
// Add your code below this line
let hound = new Dog()


<!-- 7. Extend Constructors to Receive Arguments -->
<!-- Creating an object with parameters, so it can be applied to everything 
(the example n.6, all the new instances of Dogs were named Rupert, for example.
Here we can set new parameters when we create the object.) -->
function Dog(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 4
}

let terrier = new Dog('Anammazzari', 'black')
