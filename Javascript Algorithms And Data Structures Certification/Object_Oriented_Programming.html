<!-- 1. Create a dog object with name and numLegs properties,
and set them to a string and a number, respectively. -->
let dog = {
  name: "Laura",
  numLegs: 3.
};


<!-- 2. Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object -->
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Add your code below this line

console.log(dog.name)
console.log(dog.numLegs)


<!-- 3. Create a Method on an Object -->
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + dog.numLegs + " legs."}
};

dog.sayLegs();


<!-- 4. Make Code More Reusable with the this Keyword -->
<!-- (NOTE: I change "dog.numLegs" into "this.numLegs" - so even if the object's name
is changed, we don't have to change all the references in the code. THIS, here, is
associated with.) -->
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + this.numLegs + " legs.";}
};

dog.sayLegs();


<!-- 5. Define a Constructor Function -->
<!-- Constructors are functions that create new objects. They use THIS inside -->
function Dog() {
  this.name = "Laura";
  this.color = 'Shit-brown';
  this.numLegs = 5;
}

<!-- 6. Use a Constructor to Create Objects -->
On the last line, we created a new instance of Dog named hound.
Hound has all the proprerties of Dog,so we have hound.name --> #Rupert
function Dog() {
  this.name = "Rupert";
  this.color = "brown";
  this.numLegs = 4;
}
// Add your code below this line
let hound = new Dog()
